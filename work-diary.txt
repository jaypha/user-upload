Work Diary for user_upload


Basic script outline

- process command line arguments
- process input
- create database if requested
- save entries

Considerations
- Use my own mysqli package?
- Use my own database creation tool?
- Use InnoDB and transactions?

Question for Catalyst
Q1: When an invalid entry is found, does 'no insert' refer to that entry alone, or the
 whole input?

Q2: Create a private or public account?
