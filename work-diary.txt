Work Diary for user_upload


Basic script outline

- process command line arguments
- process input
- create database if requested
- save entries

Considerations
- Use my own mysqli package?
- Use my own database creation tool?
- Use InnoDB and transactions?

Question for Catalyst
Q1: When an invalid entry is found, does 'no insert' refer to that entry alone, or the
 whole input?

Q2: Create a private or public account?

.........

Start with command line processing.
- Use Nette's command line tool
- Create unit tests
- Create a stub


.........

Create/Recreate tables

Wipe table if re-createing? Assume yes.
Make SQL a static text file.
Note: There is no specification of what the database is, nor any means of specifying
the database.
Name the database 'user_store'.
No need to use fixdb. 

Basic outline
- make conenction
- check for db existance
- create db if not exists
- check for table existance
- drop if exists.
- create table.

- should we output progress? Assume no


.......................

- done with reading and processing. Only entering into database is left.
- how to handle duplicate entries?
- easy to check if email already exists in input set, but need to also check against
 existing entries in database.
- do we also check against the database in a dry run? assume yes
- do the order of the error messages about invalid input neeed to match order of
 the input? make it yes.

- I'm thinking I need a class for file processing.
 It makes checking for duplicates less complicated.
